First, I can confirm this will fit an Ender 3d Pro. If you have v-slot covers on the top of your right, front, foot (what the PCB board is attached to) you will need to remove them.

Second: For other morons out there like me, who just started slamming pieces together, then stared at a confused manner at the original instructions, just stop and watch the assembly video from Sundown555's comment on August 25, 2020. This will explain a lot. He is now officially my hero and the reason I didn't flip the desk my printer sat on.

TL;DR tips:

The tapered slide rail cover with four slide pegs goes on the TOP of the right, front, foot with the tapered side forward. (Not on the right side of the foot, which I assumed since I had v-slot covers in).
The tapered slide rail cover should have two small holes about 1/3 total distance on the front and back, left side of the print. Small pegs from the flat side wall will insert into here to allow things to "click" into place. Make sure the holes are clear and well defined.
Make sure the flat, triangle shaped, side wall has the two very tiny side pegs on the the bottom. This plugs into the slide rail cover and holds things together. I didn't initially notice they were there.
I don't know if I would dry fit the side wall pegs into the tapered slide rail cover. I did so I could see how it worked, but when I tried to pull them apart, one peg broke off. (A dab of super glue saved a new print).

Made this awhile back and ever since installing it there has been a beep every minute or so while printing. when the beep is heard, the menu screen changes to the next menu. then once the beep is heard again it switches back to the main screen. seems to be no issues printing but its annoying to listen to and has only started after I installed these drawers and plugged the ribbon cable back in. I've tried unplugging it and plugging it back in but nothing. I've read a few articles that mention that the screws on the front, that mount the LCD panel to the frame, act as a ground for the printer. Now that the plastic is in-between the screws and the frame it is not grounded and therefore that is why it is beeping. Anyone have any clue how to fix this? I really don't want to print out a different set of drawers as I really like these
